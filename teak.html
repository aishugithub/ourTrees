        <h2>Interesting Facts about Teak</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exceptional Durability:</strong> Teak wood contains natural oils and silica, making it highly resistant to water, pests, and rot. This is why it is widely used in shipbuilding and outdoor furniture.</li>
            <li><strong>Long Lifespan:</strong> Teak trees can live for over 100 years, and some plantations harvest trees only after 60-80 years for the best quality wood.</li>
            <li><strong>Golden Brown Wood:</strong> Freshly cut teak wood is yellowish, but it matures to a rich golden brown over time due to oxidation and exposure to sunlight.</li>
            <li><strong>Medicinal Uses:</strong> In traditional medicine, teak leaves and bark have been used to treat headaches, wounds, and skin diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Ecological Role:</strong> Teak plantations can help restore degraded lands and provide habitat for various species, though natural teak forests are increasingly rare.</li>
            <li><strong>National Symbol:</strong> Teak is the national tree of Myanmar (Burma), where some of the world's largest and oldest teak trees are found.</li>
        </ul>
